                <br><strong>Spanish</strong><br><br>
                After Portugal's success at traveling across the Sahara desert(see the Portugal slide for more info),<br>
                the Spanish thought that they could do the same. This led to them also develop better sailing and<br>
                navigating techniques that enabled them to have the ability to compete with the Portuguese at trading.<br>
                However, unlike the Portuguese, the Spanish thought that since Earth is round, they could travel<br>
                through the Atlantic Ocean to reach Asia. Christopher Columbus, the most famous Spanish explorer,<br>
                did exactly that by traveling across the Atlantic Ocean, but he stumbled upon the Americas since<br>
                he did not know there's another land in between Europe and Asia. Surprisingly, Columbus found lots<br>
                of gold, treasure, and other valuable supplies there, which led to more Spanish expeditions to the<br>
                Americas. With the Treaty of Tordesillas(see the Portugal slide for more info), even more Spainish<br>
                were driven to migrate to the Americas for permanent settlements. The settlements also allowed<br>
                Europeans to have access to more lands, which defined their status, so many Spanish are trying<br>
                to get to the Americas as a way to improve their status.

                <br><strong>British (Before 13 Colonies)</strong><br><br>
                The British colonies were split into two parts at first when they came to the Americas.<br>
                One of them is at the Northeast part of the United States, consisting of modern day Maine,<br>
                New Hamphire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut. Another colonization is<br>
                at the Southeast part of the Untied States, consisting of modern day Georgia, South Carolina,<br>
                North Carolina, Virginia, and Maryland. The British first came to the Americas with the thought<br>
                to increase all individual's wealth, power, and status with the gold, silver, and other<br>
                treasures that they thought would be free of taking. They also thought that the Native<br>
                Americans would see themselves as higher, better beings, which would make them work for the<br>
                British willingly. This led to many people, without any agricultural experiences at all, traveling<br>
                across the Atlantic Ocean to get to the Americas, where they established the first ever colonization<br>
                in Jamestown, Virginia. After their settlement in Jamestown, the British colonists started cultivating<br>
                tobacco. The massive tobacco cultivation and its economic success drove even more British to come to<br>
                the Americas with the hopes of becoming wealthier.

                <br><strong>French</strong><br><br>
                Like all other European countries, France is trying to find a shorter, better route to Asia to access<br>
                the Silk Road trades. They traveled across the Americas in hopes of finding the Northwest passage,<br>
                a route that directly connects Asia and the Americas through a small path in Northern Canada. As a<br>
                result, the French settled in the northern regions of the United States, including the states west<br>
                of the Mississippi river and above the Spanish colonization territory, and parts of Canada. Moreover,<br>
                the French later found out that the Northern regions of the United States and Canada are inhabited by<br>
                a large population of beavers, whose fur are extremely valuable and useful. This led them to establish<br>
                trading posts for the animal fur trades, which is a huge economic success for them. Eventually, the<br>
                growing fur trade led many more French colonists to come to the Americas. It also made the French<br>
                colonies spread across the Americas even more in order to hunt down more beavers(once the hunting region<br>
                is low in the number of beavers, the French have to explore more lands in search of more beavers).<br>
                However, the fur trade led to a massive reduction in beaver population, impacted the Native Americans<br>
                with food depletions, and destroyed various natural environments and habitats.

            <div id="slideDutch" style="position: absolute; width: 100%; height: 100%; background-color: red; text-align: center; transition: left 1s; color: white; font-size: 125%;">
                <br><br><strong>Dutch</strong><br><br>
                The Dutch came to the Americas mostly to increase the volume of their trades, so they only<br>
                colonized New Jersey, Long Island(New York), and Delaware, which were all coastal lands that<br>
                are better and more efficient at trading with other countries. Another reason for them to stay<br>
                at the coastal regions of the Americas is that in 1492, the Spanish began to determine if people<br>
                are Catholic enough or not, which was known as the Spanish Inquisition. If not, then those people<br>
                will be forced out of the country. Since most non-Catholics were Jews who were already rich<br>
                merchants, they have the wealth to leave and join the Ottoman Empire, who welcomed them<br>
                full-heartedly in order to gain access to the Silk Road trades. Since there are already many Jews<br>
                in the Dutch colonies, they could just make trades with the Jews in the Ottoman Empire,<br>
                eliminating the need to explore the west of the Americas.

                <strong>Portugal</strong><br><br>
                Due to the fall of Constantinople, the Ottoman Empire now controls most of the trades in the<br>
                Silk Road. Since most of the goods with better qualities were traded first in the beginning of<br>
                the Silk Road, the European countries at the end of the Silk Road can only receive the ones left<br>
                with poorer qualities. This means that they had to pay more money for a lower quality. Ultimately,<br>
                this drove Portugal away to find another route to reach Asia to gain more access to the Silk Road.<br>
                The lack of trade motivated Portugal to develop sailing techniques that allowed them to sail across<br>
                the Sahara desert and straight to Asia, making them the most powerful European country during that<br>
                time. However, the Treaty of Tordesillas was established to ensure that both Spain(see Spanish slide<br>
                for more info) and Portugal have a monopoly in their trade routes but at the same time reduce some<br>
                of the tension and competition between the two strong nations. With the Line of Demarcation established<br>
                in Treaty of Tordesillas, the world was split in half with an imaginary line separating the Americas<br>
                with Asia, Africa, Europe, and a small portion of Brazil. This allowed the Spanish to gain access to<br>
                all the Americas, while the Potuguese can have access to Brazil. This led to Portugal colonizing Brazil<br>
                to explore more land and trade. This also made Brazil a Portuguese-speaking country, unlike the other<br>
                South American Spanish-speaking countries that it is surrounded by. Moreover, it also started the <br>
                Age of Exploration and caused the fall of the Mali Empire.

                <br><br><strong>13 Colonies</strong><br><br>
                The original 13 colonies were the result of the mergence of the two British colonies. After<br>
                the British acquired the two lands of the Americas as their colonies, they found out that the<br>
                two colonies lacked communication and cooperation. Meanwhile, the other colonies, especially<br>
                Spain and France, are growing larger and stronger every day. This urged the British to unify<br>
                their two colonies by squeezing out the Dutch colony that's in between their two colonies to<br>
                form a better, stronger British colony. As a resullt, the orginal 13 colonies were formed.<br>
                The original 13 colonies included Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland,<br>
                Delaware, Pennsylvania, New York, Connecticut, New Jersey, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts<br>
                (which includes Maine back then). All these colonies later became the first few states in the<br>
                United States, which is why many Eastern states have British names in them.
